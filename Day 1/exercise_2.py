"""Your job is to change the given string s using a non-negative integer n.

Each bit in n will specify whether or not to swap the case for each alphabetic character in s: if the bit is 1, swap the case; if its 0, leave it as is. When you finished with the last bit of n, start again with the first bit.

You should skip the checking of bits when a non-alphabetic character is encountered, but they should be preserved in their original positions."""
