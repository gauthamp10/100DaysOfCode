### No clue but dedicated.
Just committed to the challenge. Let's me start of with something completely random. Today I've managed to do two challenges:

- darkprinx/100-plus-Python-programming-exercises-extended - generate_numbers_with_constraints.py
- Swap Case Using N from codewars - SwapCaseN_6kyu-Codewarws.py
