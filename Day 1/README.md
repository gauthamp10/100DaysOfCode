### No clue but dedicated.
Just committed to the challenge. Let's me start off with something completely random. Today I've managed to do two challenges:

- [darkprinx/100-plus-Python-programming-exercises-extended](https://github.com/darkprinx/100-plus-Python-programming-exercises-extended/blob/master/notebooks/Day_01.ipynb) - generate_numbers_with_constraints.py
- [Swap Case Using N from codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5f3afc40b24f090028233490) - SwapCaseN_6kyu-Codewarws.py
